                <p>
                    <strong>Lorem Ipsum</strong> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the <br/> industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and <br/> scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into<br/> electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of<br/> Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like<br/> Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.<br/>

                <p>
                    It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking<br/> at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters,<br/> as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop<br/> publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for<br/> 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years,<br/> sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).<br/>

                    Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin<br/> literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at<br/> Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem<br/> Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable<br/> source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The<br/> Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very<br/> popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes<br/> from a line in section 1.10.32.<br/><br/>

                    The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections<br/> 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original<br/> form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.<br/>

                    There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in<br/> some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are<br/> going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the<br/> middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as<br/> necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words,<br/> combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable.<br/> The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic<br/> words etc.
